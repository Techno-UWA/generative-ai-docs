Keeping Standards up-to-date 

Australian Standards® are living documents that reflect progress in science, technology and 
systems. To maintain their currency, all Standards are periodically reviewed, and new editions 
are published. Between editions, amendments may be issued. 

Standards may also be withdrawn. It is important that readers assure themselves they are 
using a current Standard, which should include any amendments that may have been 
published since the Standard was published. 

Detailed information about Australian Standards, drafts, amendments and new projects can 
be found by visiting www.standards.org.au 


Standards Australia welcomes suggestions for improvements, and encourages readers to 
notify us immediately of any apparent inaccuracies or ambiguities. Contact us via email at 
mail@standards.org.au, or write to Standards Australia, GPO Box 476, Sydney, NSW 2001.

PREFACE 

General 

This Standard was prepared by the Joint Standards Australia/Standards New Zealand 
Committee FP-018, Fire Tests on Building Components, Materials and Structures, to 
supersede AS 1530.4—2005. 

After consultation with stakeholders in both countries, Standards Australia and Standards 
New Zealand decided to develop this Standard as an Australian Standard rather than an 
Australian/New Zealand Standard. 

Development and International Standards 

This Standard aligns with the general principles and procedures set out in the ISO 834 
series, Fire-resistance tests—Elements of building construction, of Standards and other 
related ISO documents. This Standard also includes references to relevant European 
Standards, as appropriate. 

This Standard references normative and informative documents. Normative referenced 
documents are listed in Clause 1.5, and informative referenced documents are listed in the 
Bibliography. 

The terms ‘normative’ and ‘informative’ have been used in this Standard to define the 
application of the appendix to which they apply. A ‘normative’ appendix is an integral part 
of the Standard, whereas an ‘informative’ appendix is only for information and guidance. 

The use of Notes in this Standard is of an advisory nature only. They provide explanations 
and guidance on recommended design consideration or technical procedures, as well as an 
informative cross-reference to other documents or publications. 

This Standard incorporates a Commentary on some clauses. The Commentary directly 
follows the relevant clause, is designated by ‘C’ preceding the clause number and is 
printed in italics in a panel. The Commentary is for information only and does not need 
to be followed for compliance with the Standard.
