This report contains the minimum information sufficient for regulatory compliance and refers to the 
referenced assessment report FAS190235 R1.20. Summaries of the test data on which the 
referenced assessment is based are provided in the appendices which are only available in the full 
report. 
The referenced assessment report documents the findings of the assessment undertaken to 
determine the fire resistance level (FRL) of service penetrations through TBA FireflyTM Intubatt 
systems fitted to vertical and horizontal substrates in accordance with AS 1530.4:2014 and assessed 
in accordance with AS 4072.1:2005. 







- TBA FireflyTM Insulated Penowrap® System: A two component system consisting of (1st layer) 
25 mm thick high temperature high density Fortaglas. (2nd layer) Phoenix RS 440 g woven 
Fortaglas cloth with a silicone coating. 



different Fire-Resistant Substrates. These retro-ﬁt ﬁre collars are made from a steel outer 
shell containing high pressure exerting graphite intumescent strips. 
The referenced assessment report is based upon TBA FireflyTM Systems which were tested in 
accordance with AS 1530.4:2014 and assessed in accordance with AS 4072.1:2005. This report 
meets compliance with Specification A2.3 Section 2 (c) of NCC2016 Amendment 1 (Including Prior 
Versions) & Schedule 5 Section 2 (c) of NCC2019 (Including Amendment 1) for determination of an 
FRL. 
The purpose of the referenced assessment report is to be used in conjunction with other tests and 
assessments of TBA FireflyTM Intubatt barriers only. 
The analysis in the referenced assessment report found that the proposed variations are expected to 
achieve fire resistance performance as shown in Table 1 to Table 8e in accordance with 
AS 1530.4:2014. Services summarised in Table 1 to Table 8e shall be spaced at a minimum 40 mm 
from each other in vertical and horizontal substrates. 
Services summarised in Table 1 to Table 8e may be positioned close to the interface between TBA 
Firefly™ Intubatt (main firestopping) and the aperture of the wall or floor (the primary fire separating 
element), where: 




The TBA Firefly™ Intubatt is in an aperture fit for primary fire separating elements in the 
assessment FAS190234 report RIR1.7 dated 28 July 2022 or other subsequent revisions of 
the report. 
Services maintain the minimum annular gaps described in ‘local fire protection’ in the tables 
and additional figures where listed in this report. 
The separating element is at least the same thickness as the total thickness of the TBA 
Firefly™ Intubatt layers.

An assessment is an opinion about the expected performance of a component or element of structure 
if it was subject to a standard fire test. 
No specific framework, methodology, standard or guidance documents exists in Australia for doing 
these assessments. We have therefore followed the ‘Guide to undertaking technical assessments of 




 

the fire performance of construction products based on fire test evidence’ prepared by the Passive 
Fire Protection Forum (PFPF) in the UK in 20191. 
This guide provides a framework for undertaking assessments in the absence of specific fire test 
results. Some areas where assessments may be offered are: 




The interpolation or extrapolation of results of a series of fire resistance tests, or utilisation of 
a series of fire test results to evaluate a range of variables in a construction design or a 
product 
Where, for various reasons – eg size or configuration – it is not possible to subject a 
construction or a product to a fire test. 
Assessments will vary from relatively simple judgements on small changes to a product or 
construction through to detailed and often complex engineering assessments of large or sophisticated 
constructions. 
The referenced assessment uses established empirical methods and our experience of fire testing 
similar products to extend the scope of application by determining the limits for the design based on 
the tested constructions and performances obtained. The assessment is an evaluation of the potential 
fire resistance performance if the elements were to be tested in accordance with AS 1530.4:2014. 
The referenced assessment has been written using appropriate test evidence generated at accredited 
laboratories to the relevant test standard. The supporting test evidence has been deemed appropriate 
to support the manufacturer’s stated design. 

The referenced assessment report has been prepared to meet the evidence of suitability 
requirements of the National Construction Code Volumes One and Two – Building Code of Australia 
(NCC) 2019 Amendment 12 under A.5.2.(1) (d) and schedule 5 for determination of an FRL and 2016 
under specification A2.3, including amendments. 
0The referenced assessment has been written in accordance with the general principles outlined in 
EN 15725:20103 for extended application reports on the fire performance of construction products and 
building elements. It also references test evidence for meeting a performance requirement or deemed 
to satisfy (DTS) provisions of the NCC under A5.4 for fire resistance levels as applicable to the 
assessed systems. 
The referenced assessment report may also be used to demonstrate compliance with the 
requirements for evidence of suitability under NCC 2016 including Amendments4. 

The ‘Guide to undertaking technical assessments of the fire performance of construction products 
based on fire test evidence’ prepared by the PFPF in the UK requires a declaration from the client. By 
accepting our fee proposal on 6 April 2021, TBA Firefly™ division of TBA Textiles P/L confirmed that: 


To their knowledge the component or element of structure, which is the subject of the 
referenced assessment, has not been subjected to a fire test to the standard against which 
the referenced assessment is being made. 
They agree to withdraw the referenced assessment from circulation if the component or 
element of structure is the subject of a fire test by a test authority in accordance with the 
standard against which the referenced assessment is being made and the results are not in 
agreement with the referenced assessment.

They are not aware of any information that could adversely affect the conclusions of the 
referenced assessment and – if they subsequently become aware of any such information – 
they agree to ask the assessing authority to withdraw the assessment. 










The scope of the referenced assessment report is limited to an assessment of the variations 
to the tested systems described in section 4.3. 
The referenced assessment report details the methods of construction, test conditions and 
assessed results that are expected in accordance with AS 1530.4:2014. 
We confirm that any changes which subject of this assessment have not been to our 
knowledge been tested to the standards against which this assessment has been made. 
The results of referenced assessment report are applicable to TBA FireflyTM Intubatt barriers 
in vertical substrates exposed to fire from either side in horizontal substrates exposed to fire 
from below. 
The purpose of the referenced assessment report is to be used in conjunction with other tests 
and assessments of TBA FireflyTM Intubatt barriers only. 
The supporting vertical and horizontal substrate construction shall be capable of providing 
effective support of the proposed construction for the required fire resistance period (FRL): 


The Speedpanel wall shall be constructed as appropriate for a non- load bearing 
service aperture. The wall shall otherwise be tested or assessed for an FRL of 
-/120/120. 
The Kingflor profile floor structural design shall be tested or assessed to include floor 
penetrations without compromising structural adequacy. 
The referenced assessment report is only valid for the assessed systems and must not be 
used for any other purpose. Any changes with respect to size, construction details, loads, 
stresses, edge or end conditions – other than those identified in this report – may invalidate 
the findings of the referenced assessment. If there are changes to the system, a 
reassessment will need to be done by an Accredited Testing Laboratory (ATL). 
The referenced assessment report has been prepared based on information provided by 
others. Warringtonfire has not verified the accuracy and/or completeness of that information 
and will not be responsible for any errors or omissions that may be incorporated into this 
report as a result. 
The referenced assessment report is based on the proposed systems being constructed 
under comprehensive quality control practices and following appropriate industry regulations 
and Australian Standards on quality of materials, design of structures, guidance on 
workmanship and the expert handling, placing and finishing of the products on site. These 
variables are beyond the control and consideration of this report. 


A range of service penetrations through various supporting construction in vertical and horizontal 
substrates have been tested in accordance with various revisions of AS 1530.4. Refer to Appendix A 
in the referenced assessment report for a full summary of the referenced test data. 

The assessment of the variation to the tested system and the determination of the expected 
performance is based on the results of the fire tests documented in the reports summarised in Table 
10. Further details of the tested system are included in referenced assessment report.

When designing busway supports (designed by others) , for the supporting to be able to sustain the 
load of the busways, the following considerations must be taken in the design process : 




Not exceeding the maximum capacity of steel uni strut members at ambient and elevated 
temperature levels. 
Maintaining safe deflection levels and make sure that the load is not transferred to the fire 
sealing system. 
Support is sized in suitable way to accommodate total mass or load for the number of 
busways that are being supported.

All service penetrations must be supported on both sides of the seal. The supports must be designed to 
accommodate the required load of the service penetration under normal conditions. Please note that the 
graphic provided below is for illustrative purposes only. 
In this report, all service penetrations, including those that require wrapping with TBA Firefly™ Penowrap®, 
were tested with supports on the non-fire side only for both vertical and horizontal separating elements. 
According to AS 1530.4:2014, penetrations are not supported within the furnace. However, for vertical 
separating elements, it is necessary to have static load support on both sides during onsite installation. 
If the onsite application involves supports within the area covered by TBA Firefly™ Penowrap® (Item 11), it is 
important to ensure that the wrap is cut neatlly (mxuimum cut out is 5 mm and filled with TBE FireflyTM 
intumastic sealant) around the support. In such cases, the support does not require additional insulation 
protection. Please note that AS 1530.4:2014 does not provide specific requirements for the attachment of 
thermocouples in the test procedure for this particular support element or component. However, the test 
results and assessments are considered compliant with the test standard.

On the basis of the discussion presented in the referenced assessment report, it is the opinion of this 
testing authority that if the tested prototypes described in section 4.1 had been varied as in section 
4.3, they will achieve the fire resistance performances summarised in Table 1 to Table 8e in 
accordance with the test method referenced in section 4.4 and subject to the requirements of sections 
2, 3 and 6. 

Warringtonfire Australia does not endorse the tested or assessed product in any way. The conclusions 
of the referenced assessment may be used to directly assess fire hazard, but it should be recognised 
that a single test method will not provide a full assessment of fire hazard under all conditions. 
Due to the nature of fire testing and the consequent difficulty in quantifying the uncertainty of 
measurement, it is not possible to provide a stated degree of accuracy. The inherent variability in test 
procedures, materials and methods of construction, and installation may lead to variations in 
performance between elements of similar construction. 
This assessment is based on information and experience available at the time of preparation. The 
published procedures for the conduct of tests and the assessment of test results are subject to 
constant review and improvement. It is therefore recommended that this report be reviewed on, or 
before, the stated expiry date. 
This assessment represents our opinion about the performance expected to be demonstrated on a 
test in accordance with AS 1530.4:2014, based on the evidence referred to in this report.
